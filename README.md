- The data includes Order ID, Product, Quantity Ordered, Price Each, Order Date, and Purchase Address.
  
# Additional columns were extracted for analysis 
- Month, Month Name, Year, Sales, City_State, Hour, and Minute.
  
# Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Matplotlib – for data visualization
- Seaborn – for enhanced visualizations
- OS – for handling multiple files
  
# Data Cleaning Steps
- Merged 12 months of sales data into a single DataFrame.
- Removed missing values from the dataset.
- Removed invalid rows based on conditions (e.g., incorrect data entries).
- Converted data types where necessary (numeric, datetime, string conversions).

# Analysis Performed
- Best Month for Sales
  - Identified the month with the highest total sales.
  - Visualized sales trends over the months.

- Total Sales Over Months in All Years
  - Analyzed overall sales performance throughout the year.
  - Created a graph to visualize the trend.

- City-wise Sales Analysis
  - Determined which city and the highest number of sales.
  - Plotted a graph to compare sales across different cities.

- Best Time to Display Advertisements
  - Analyzed sales data based on time (hours and minutes).
  - Identified the best time to run advertisements for maximum sales.
  - Performed A/B hypothesis testing to validate the findings.

- Products Most Often Sold Together
  - Identified product combinations frequently bought together.
  - Used data grouping techniques to extract insights.

- Most Sold Product and Hypothesis Testing
  - Found the product with the highest sales volume.
  - Explored possible reasons why it was the most popular.
  - Used hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.

# Visualizations and Used Graphs
  - Bar charts and line graphs were used to visualize trends over time

# Results and Insights
  - Sales peaked in specific months, highlighting seasonal demand.
  - Certain cities contributed more to overall revenue.
  - Customer purchase behavior varied throughout the day, indicating optimal ad placement times.
  - Frequently bought-together products present opportunities for cross-selling.
  - The highest-selling product had a strong correlation with price, availability, and customer demand.
